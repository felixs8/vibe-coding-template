## About This Project

_Please describe here what this project is all about._  
This section is meant for a short, human-readable description of the product. Summarize the problem it solves, who it is for, and what the main functionality is. Think of it as the first thing a visitor should read when opening the repository.

## Getting Started

This project follows a quality-focused development process where a **human vibe coder** works together with **AI agents** to build the system step by step through structured thinking and clear communication.  
Instead of relying on past conversations, we store all relevant context in a set of **artifacts** inside the repository. These artifacts act as the shared memory of the project. They explain what we want to build, how we plan to build it, what “done” means, what we have built so far, and which tasks remain.

The advantage is that any AI agent—or any human contributor—can join the project at any time, read the artifacts, and immediately understand the current state without needing additional explanations. This makes development transparent, consistent, and agent-agnostic.

You will find the following artifacts in this repository under `project-management/`:

- `project-management/guidelines.md` – explains the process and the role of each artifact. **Start here.**
- `project-management/requirements.md` – describes what we want to build.
- `project-management/target_architecture.md` – shows how we intend to build it.
- `project-management/current_architecture.md` – records what exists in the system right now.
- `project-management/definition_of_done.md` – defines what counts as finished work.
- `project-management/tasks/` – contains one file per task, documenting progress incrementally.

Reading `project-management/guidelines.md` first will help you understand the process and how to contribute.
