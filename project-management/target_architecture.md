# Target Architecture

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI component library
- **Testing**: Cypress for E2E and component testing
- **Language**: TypeScript for full type safety
- **Deployment**: Vercel (optimized for Next.js)
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack for fast development and builds

## High-level Components

- **Next.js App Router**: Server-side rendering and client components
- **UI Component Layer**: DaisyUI components styled with Tailwind CSS
- **API Layer**: Next.js API routes (`/api/*`) for backend functionality
- **Testing Suite**: Cypress tests for quality assurance
- **Type System**: TypeScript across all components and configurations

## Data Flows / APIs

1. User interacts with Next.js frontend components
2. Client-side requests to Next.js API routes (`/api/*`) when needed
3. API routes handle business logic and external integrations
4. Data flows back through React component hierarchy
5. Cypress tests validate end-to-end user flows and component behavior

## Risks and Constraints

- **Vercel Build Limits**: Free tier has execution time limits; may need Pro plan for complex builds
- **Bundle Size Management**: DaisyUI and Tailwind need proper tree-shaking to avoid bloat
- **Testing Pipeline Integration**: Cypress CI/CD setup requires careful configuration

## Open Questions

- Which database technology best fits future project requirements?
- Should we use Next.js API routes or integrate with external services?
- Do we need server-side authentication or client-side session management?
