# Target Architecture

## Target Architecture (fill in for this project)

### Tech Stack

_List the technologies you will use (frontend, backend, database, etc.)._

### High-level Components

_Describe the major building blocks of the system._

### Data Flows / APIs

_Outline how data moves through the system and which APIs exist._

### Risks and Constraints

_Note risks, technical constraints, or limitations._

### Open Questions

_Capture architectural decisions still to be made._

---

## Example (delete if not needed)

Sample architecture for a hypothetical "Bookstore Web App".

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: React with TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes

### High-level Components

- Web frontend serving React app
- REST API backend
- Database schema with books, users, and orders
- Payment service integration

### Data Flows / APIs

1. User requests book list from frontend.
2. Frontend queries `/api/books`.
3. Backend queries PostgreSQL and returns JSON.
4. Payment requests go from backend to provider.

### Risks and Constraints

- Payment provider integration may introduce latency.
- Scalability for catalog search needs to be validated.

### Open Questions

- Should we use GraphQL instead of REST?
- Should we add caching in front of the DB?

## Further Suggestions

### Deployment

CI/CD pipeline, environments, release strategy.

### Scalability

Horizontal vs. vertical scaling approach.

### Security

AuthN/AuthZ design, encryption, secrets management.

### Fault Tolerance

How the system recovers from failures.

### Monitoring

Metrics, logging, observability stack.

### Extensibility

Plugin or modular architecture options.

### Performance Targets

Expected throughput and latency.

### Technology Alternatives

Rejected options and rationale.

### Infrastructure

Cloud provider and resource sizing.

### Data Modeling

ER diagrams, schema notes, migrations.
